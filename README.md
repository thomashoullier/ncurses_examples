# ncurses example
We run the ncurses examples from the following manual,

NCURSES Programming HOWTO (http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/docs/HOWTO/other-formats/pdf/NCURSES-Programming-HOWTO.pdf)

We made small tweaks to adapt some of the examples to C++, and correct
obvious mistakes.

Note the complete API is documented in the ncurses man pages.
